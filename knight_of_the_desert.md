# Synopsis

In summary, this book confirms the hypothesis that Sheikh Zayed’s sayings encapsulate a comprehensive knowledge that is the outcome of a complex process. They are not a mere expression of traditional matters, but a creative force that underpins a leading knowledge moulded into a distinct linguistic style that reveals the depth and the diversity of the founding leader’s experience. Sheikh Zayed did not philosophise, but he employed his knowledge and experience to serve his compatriots. Consequently, the outcome was an exquisite “Arabesque-like” masterpiece of perfection in which each saying has interrelated psychological, philosophical, and religious dimensions of great value.

At the end of this study, I can conclude that Sheikh Zayed was a unique and versatile figure that surpassed all classification. This study attempted to reveal the solid identity behind this versatility and to read the traits of this great figure in its attitude towards the man and the world through its various approaches to quotidian situations. Sheikh Zayed rose above the image of the leader and shone as a bright star in the firmament of innovation and literature. His sayings were a special work of art; a creative artistic text in which the voice of the leader resonates, carrying us to the depth of the governing experience. These texts were the confluence of various characters in a single identity that dovetails with the character of the leading knight. The images of Sheikh Zayed are diverse, and his voices are multiple: the voice of the father, the voice of the leader, the voice of the philosopher, and the voice of the teacher, who explains and shows the way ahead. Moreover, these voices intertwine and chime with action like sound and echo. The lower voice in his quotes is the voice of the ego. His sayings are the clear expression of his deep commitment to the human values and to the causes of his nation in particular and the world in general. Additionally, they transcribe the reality of the Emirates, wherein various nationalities and cultures are integrated in a unique milieu that revives the glory of the leading Islamic culture and draws the aspects of an extraordinary future under the banner of excellence and investment in the capabilities of the youth. On the other hand, my task as critic moved from the field of analysis to prove the ability of these sayings to overpass all interpretations. In my modest opinion, the leader’s deep understanding of Islamic thought, his familiarity with the intellectual Arabic tradition, and his broad view of human knowledge had greatly influenced his own perception of the world. Concisely, the years have deepened his culture, matured his genius, and increased his awareness. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank this great leader, who made the goal of building the man a priority and engraved his name on hearts before leaving his mark on the books of history.
